# What are these?!

These are all of my old projects!

And I mean *old*

I used to start and abandon projects with a whim, so I have a bunch of these laying around in various states of completion. I feel like this is something I've gotten better about over time, to be honest. Even so, digital packrat that I am, I've kept these around as...inspiration? Keepsakes? A warning?

No matter. I've uploaded them all here, embarrassing or not, just so that they live on in some form or another.

**You probably should not use any of them.**

That said, you're free to! They're almost all missing LICENSE files, so unless you see one of those in there, they're licensed under an MIT license.
